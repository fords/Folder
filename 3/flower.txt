I draw a square box first
Then use recursive function to draw flower by using square box function
Then go to another starting point 
Next,I draw a square box using iteration  and I use iteration for drawing a flower from using the square box function of iteration

I use size 0 and petal 100 to draw nothing but the turtle moving
I use size 100 and petal 5
size 100 and petal 1000
size -1 and petal 3 and 
size 100 and petal -3 to check my codes are working
