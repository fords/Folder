I starts the turtle face east in the lower left part of the letter
Then when turtle ends somewhere it has to go to one space and then to lower part of another letter facing east.

I run from command line typing cd Downloads
then python RIT_tigers.py
(the computer is Ubuntu)


I tested the space coordinate between RIT and TIGERS
I tested for many S letters
I put drawS() and drawT() between drawI() and drawG() for making sure function work
The outputs are RIT TIGERS
and ENTER THE KEY TO END THE PROGRAM
There are no no-required output
In the main() fucntion ,I can change the letter orders for different things
